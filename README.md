# Plants-vs-monsters

## Introduction
This is a remake of a popular game Plants vs Zombies, where you plant your defense against the zombies and don't let them enter your house. I love PvZ so much that I have created a copy of it but with many differences on my own. 
## What stands out from the original?
- The biggest modification compared to the original game is the Zombies are now changed into Monsters, which have more dangerous variations and add more challenge for your game
- There are a lot of new plants for you to make countless strategy
- There are several new level types and different mechanics that make the game less boring
- Epic boss fights
## How it was made?
The game is developed using 100% GML, with the help of Game Maker 8 and Game Maker Studio 2 (recently). I have made this game since 2020 completely by myself. Because of that, the graphics of the game are very paint-like and not so beautiful but I tried my best and I am not an artist or designer.
## The story behind
The game has been developed since 2020 using Game Maker 8. Until 2021, I lost the game file that had been developed all the way to Swamp World (world 3). Luckily, I still got the last saved file which is at level 2-6 (Middile of World 2). However, there was a lot of work had been gone and I was too suffering then decided to quit this project for a long time.<br>
In the middle of 2022, I finally got back my inspiration to make a return. This time, I managed to finish the first half of the game (4 first worlds)<br>
At the beginning of 2024, I switched to GMS2 to catch up the reality, and since GM8 is too old. The game is also needs to upgrade to compatible with the environment of GMS2. I have finished upgrading it but it remain undetected errors and a lot of warnings as you can see if you're viewing it in GMS2. Moving between versions is such a painful task<br>
Now, I finally decided to publish the game on this site so everyone knows about my work and can play it. Every time the game gets a new update, I will push it to this repository. Thank you for reading this line. Now, what are you waiting for? Let's do IT!!!
